devices. It shall be developed as a web-based service accessible through a number of hardware
platforms (iPhone, iPad, Android-based phones and tablets, Blackberry devices, Laptop-based
browsers, and others more). At the end of the project the best artefact will be selected by a
committee based on functionality, implementation quality, and documentation comprehensiveness
for potential use in classes next term. The system shall comprise of a tutor interface (to edit and
publish a question to all registered devices, and to display the result in-class), a student interface (to
answer the current question), and an appropriate backend for data management.
